# Code of Conduct

For more information on how we follow our Code of Conduct (CoC) you can read our guidelines, which are detailed further down. No one's perfect, but we expect everyone in our community to make an effort to follow our CoC so that we can foster a fun, friendly and kind environment for everyone. If you have a suggestion to improve our CoC, we recommend that you:

* Chat to the friendly admins on our slack channel about it - we love hearing feedback!
* Clone the repository, branch off and make a pull request with your modification. One of our snazzy admins will check it out soon!

# Overview
* Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.
* Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other defining characteristic.
* This code and related procedures also apply to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities, in all community venues— online and in-person— as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Expected Behavior
* Be welcoming.
* Be kind.
* Look out for each other.

## Unacceptable Behavior
* Conduct or speech which might be considered sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature.
* Do not use unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms.
* Do not show disrespect towards others. (Jokes, innuendo, dismissive attitudes.)
* Intimidation or harassment (online or in-person). Please read the Citizen Code of Conduct for how we interpret harassment.
* Disrespect towards differences of opinion.
* Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop.
* Not understanding the differences between constructive criticism and disparagement.
* Sustained disruptions.
* Violence, threats of violence or violent language.

## Enforcement
* Understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated.
* If you are the subject of, or witness to any violations of this Code of Conduct, please **contact any of the slack administrators**
* If violations occur, organizers will take any action they deem appropriate for the infraction, up to and including expulsion.

# Guidelines
These are some of the ways we do our best to implement our code of conduct.

## Slack Etiquette

### Misc

* Tangents or off-topic conversations should be moved to threads or a relevant channel. Someone wise once told me "channels are free" - feel free to start a channel to discuss a topic* if several people are interested in it.
* Use `@here` instead of `@channel` where possible. `@channel` sends everyone in the channel a mobile/desktop notification (and `@everyone` send it to everyone in the group!) - whether or not they're online, regardless of timezone... `@here` just notifies the people in the channel who are currently online.

\* Please note that the purpose of this channel must follow the guidelines above, we will remove any channels that encourage harmful attitudes or behaviour.

### #general

A lot of people are in #general! The problem with having such a popular channel is that people don't want to leave, because there can be important or relevant announcements on there. However, it can sometimes get cluttered with noise! These are some (usually unspoken) guidelines that a lot of slack groups follow, and we recommend you do, too:

* Try not to use gifs on #general - they can hide important content, and not everyone appreciates it when you [say hi](https://giphy.com/gifs/dog-sup-paul-windle-l41lShcuautqDZc5i) in [a thousand words](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/a_picture_paints_a_thousand_words)!
* Post in #general when you think it's relevant to everyone in the group. If in doubt, use #random instead of #general, because just as many people are on it, but they can mute notifications without [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out), and you won't accidentally hide a potentially important announcement with [Frameworks as Cats](http://whichcatisyourjavascriptframework.com).
* Don’t use `@channel` on #general unless you’re an admin notifying everyone in the group about an important change.
